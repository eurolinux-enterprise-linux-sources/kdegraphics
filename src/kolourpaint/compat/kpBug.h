    // Qt 4.1.1 qt-copy/src/corelib/tools/qrect.cpp:
    //
    //     QRect QRect::normalized() const
    //     {
    //         if (isNull() || width() == 0 || height() == 0)

    //
    // This check was not in Qt3. Â It is also wrong.
    //
    // e.g. QRect rect = QRect (thisPoint, lastPoint).normalize ()
    //
    // This innocent looking line will work for all values of "thisPoint" and
    // "lastPoint", _except_ for 5 special cases by my count:
    //
    //     +++
    //     +*
    //     +
    //
    // Where "*" is the topLeft point and "+" are the troublesome bottomRight
    // points.
    //

    // QRect_Normalized() will use the Qt3 behaviour and therefore, work for
    // all input.
